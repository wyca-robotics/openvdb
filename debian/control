Description: Sparse Volume Processing toolkit - lib
 OpenVDB is an open source C++ library comprising a novel hierarchical data
 structure and a suite of tools for the efficient storage and manipulation of
 sparse volumetric data discretized on three-dimensional grids. It is developed
 and maintained by DreamWorks Animation for use in volumetric applications
 typically encountered in feature film production.
